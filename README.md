# Password Generator 
## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to apply newly learned JavaScript skills (creation of variables, conditonal statements, for loops, and functions) to create an application that generates a random password. 
Via a series of prompts, users of the application can choose the lenght of their password, and whether or not they want the password to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. 
I also built checks into the code to make sure the user chooses a valid password length, as well as at least one character type in order to generate a password that satifies the acceptance criteria.
